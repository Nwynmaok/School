Tested on 4-250 Lab Machines

Zip should contain:
- parallel_convert.c
- Makefile
- Program_overview.pdf
- Experiment writeup.pdf
- time.sh

To run code:
parallel_convert.c and Makefile should be in the same directory, along with the input_dir you wish to run with program on

Terminal:
username@Directory/path:$ make
username@Directory/path:$ parallel_convert [convert_count] [output_dir] [input_dir]


Only encountered issue:
When we were running many tests using experiment script, we had an occasional crash if we didn't delete the output_dir
